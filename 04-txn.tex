GoTxn is a transaction system we implemented and verified with the goal of
making crash safety and concurrency simple for a storage system implemented on
top. Transactions appear to run atomically both on crash and to other threads.
The GoTxn specification and proof formalize this property to enable
\emph{sequential reasoning} for a concurrent system, which is what the verified
file system DaisyNFS takes advantage of (described next in
\cref{ch:daisy-nfs}).

In this chapter we set out GoTxn's implementation and specification, then give
some interesting aspects of the proof. A common theme is a division between the
internal abstraction of \emph{journaling} and complete \emph{transactions}
provided to the caller. This division is most pronounced in the specification
and proof, since we prove a specification of independent interest about
journaling before using it to establish GoTxn's top-level specification about
transactions.

While as part of this thesis we only used GoTxn to implement and verify a file
system, in principle the system and its specification are generic for any
storage system implemented on top, as long as its operations are implemented
using transactions.
