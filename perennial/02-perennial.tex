\section{Crash weakest preconditions}

Introduce WPC and its meaning

crash framing

Most important rule: allocating an invariant cancels from the crash invariant
(encoding Perennial 1.0 reasoning)

Crash-aware locks (shouldn't really need crash borrows, only use them as part of
2PL proof because the code doesn't open and close the locks in a bracketed way)

\section{Recovery reasoning}

WPR and idempotence rule

generation numbers to explain how resources transition across a crash
(post-crash modality helps make this concrete in the form of a theorem)

In practice, recovery is the thing that sets up the invariants, cancels from its
crash condition, and then always starts up with the contents of those
invariants due to the recovery idempotence rule.

\section{Soundness}

explain how a soundness theorem relates a WPR to a statement about repeated
execution

mention that a bunch of complexity is hidden in proving that soundness theorem,
some coming from Iris base logic and some from the definition of WPC, but we
won't explain it
