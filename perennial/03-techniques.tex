\section{Reasoning techniques using Perennial}
\label{sec:perennial:techniques}

Using invariants in clever ways, for both standard concurrency reasoning and
crashes

Logically-atomic crash specs expose atomic updates to the state of a module

Notion of a ``durable'' resource via post-crash modality + combining with an
invariant

Refinement reasoning uses lower-level tools from Perennial for a different
soundness theorem
