\section{How to read this thesis}

\Cref{sec:daisy-nfs} describes the programming interface, specification,
implementation, and proof for the overall file system. When describing the
implementation and proof, a significant component is the transaction system,
which we only give an interface and specification for. The details of that proof
are in \cref{sec:txn}. The transaction system's proof required two
contributions that are part of this thesis. \Cref{sec:goose} is optional
reading on how the proof connects to the code. \Cref{sec:perennial} gives
background needed to understand how the proof itself works.
