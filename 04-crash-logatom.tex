On top of the Perennial logic, we developed a specification pattern to organize proofs
of libraries and compose them. Of particular interest is a pattern for
\emph{logically-atomic crash specifications}, which capture that a set of
methods in a library appear atomic with respect to both other threads and on
crash. In order to illustrate how all of these techniques work together, this
section walks through the specification and proof intuition for the circular
buffer, a library used in GoTxn that has interesting crash safety and
concurrency behavior. This library operates directly on top of the disk, so no
background on GoTxn is needed to understand it.
