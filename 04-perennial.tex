Perennial is a framework for reasoning about crash safety and concurrency that
we developed in order to verify GoTxn. The main component of Perennial is a
program logic based on concurrent separation logic, with extensions for
reasoning about crash and recovery behaviors.

This chapter describes Perennial's reasoning techniques used in the GoTxn proof.
Perennial is built on top of the Iris concurrency framework, and inherits its
support for reasoning about concurrency; the novelty is in reasoning about
crashes and recovery. Some knowledge of Iris is needed to fully appreciate this
chapter, but the intuition needed to understand the GoTxn chapter should be
clear to anyone.

\section{Reasoning techniques using Perennial}

Using invariants in clever ways, for both standard concurrency reasoning and
crashes

Logically-atomic crash specs expose atomic updates to the state of a module

Notion of a ``durable'' resource via post-crash modality + combining with an
invariant

Refinement reasoning uses lower-level tools from Perennial for a different
soundness theorem
