Perennial is a verification framework for crash safety and concurrency, built on
top of Iris. We give only the background needed for a systems audience to
understand the GoJournal proof strategy.

Need background on standard weakest preconditions (explaining relation to Hoare
logic) and separation logic.

The main idea is to extend standard weakest preconditions with an additional
postcondition we call a crash obligation. Then we can reason about recovery
using a usual recovery idempotence rule, even across crashes.

\tej{Not sure exactly what we need to say to connect it to GoJournal. I would
like to get enough of a handle on this to explain how we encode the specs for
a crash abstraction, like the circular buffer at least, which means explaning
HOCAP and the crash obligation canceling pattern, and how that fits into the
top-level recovery idempotence.}
