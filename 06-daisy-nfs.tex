DaisyNFS is a verified, concurrent, and crash-safe file system, built on top of
GoTxn. This chapter describes its specification, implementation, and proof. A
key aspect of DaisyNFS is that the proofs of the file-system code use \emph{sequential
reasoning}, even though DaisyNFS is a concurrent file system --- this is possible
due to a \emph{simulation-transfer theorem}. The theorem uses the strong
guarantee of GoTxn to enable verifying a system written with transactions using
entirely different techniques, so that the file-system proofs are carried out in
Dafny, a sequential verification-oriented programming language.
