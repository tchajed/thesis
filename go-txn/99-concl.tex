\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:gotxn:concl}

GoTxn is a concurrent, crash-safe transaction system with a machine-checked
proof. The caller wraps a sequence of reads and writes in a transaction, which
the transaction system promises to make atomic. We formalized the system's
atomicity guarantee in the form of a \emph{program refinement} specification,
which says that when the caller issues an arbitrary sequence of transactions,
they appear to execute atomically, even if transactions are issued concurrently
and if the system crashes. GoTxn is verified against its program refinement
specification using Perennial. The proof is modular, using Perennial's logically
atomic crash specifications to verify each layer separately and compose the
proofs together. Of particular note in the proof is the \emph{lifting-based
specification} specification of the journaling layer that captures what
concurrent transactions do.
