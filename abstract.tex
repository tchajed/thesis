The file system is an important service of the operating system, yet
implementations still occasionally have bugs that can lead to incorrect results
or even data loss. What makes it difficult to write a correct file system is
that even simple operations can execute in many ways due to concurrency and
power failures, making it challenging to think through or test all
possibilities. Formal verification offers a promising solution by using a proof
to show the file-system code always meets its specification.

This thesis develops DaisyNFS, a verified, concurrent, and performant file
system. The first contribution is new verification foundations for crashes and
concurrency that make it possible to reason about high-performance, realistic storage
systems at all. The second contribution is the design and implementation of the
file system on top. DaisyNFS has a verification-friendly design based on
transactions so that most of
the code enjoys sequential reasoning. Underlying the file system is a
verified, high-performance transaction system with sophisticated concurrency.
The overall file system is performant compared to Linux NFS exporting ext4 over
a range of benchmarks --- at least 75\% the throughput in even single-threaded,
in-memory workloads, and comparable performance when multiple clients are
writing concurrently.
