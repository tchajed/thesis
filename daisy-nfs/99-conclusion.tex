\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented \sys, a verified crash-safe,
concurrent file system. \sys was built with verification in mind in
two parts: a transaction system and a file system whose operations run
as a transaction. This design allowed us to use the sharpest tool for
each part: Perennial for concurrency and crash-safety reasoning and
Dafny for sequential reasoning with much proof automation inside a
transaction.  The specification of the transaction system was
carefully designed to meet the assumptions that Dafny makes, but
requires some by-hand auditing to confirm.  Overall this approach
results in proof overhead of about $2\times$ for the file system part
(vs. $18\times$ for the transaction system), allowing us to verify and
build a functional and performing file system.

% That's all, folks!
