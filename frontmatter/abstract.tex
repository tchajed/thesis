Critical systems software such as the file system is challenging to make correct
due to the combination of concurrency in the implementation for good performance
and the requirement to preserve data even on crash, where the whole computer
stops and reboots unexpectedly. To build reliable systems, this thesis focuses
on formal verification, proving that a system always meets a mathematical
specification of its behavior, and contributes new techniques to enable
verification of systems software with a combination of concurrency and crash
guarantees.

The thesis applies these techniques to the verification of DaisyNFS, a new
concurrent file system. The file system is an important service of an operating
system, because nearly all persistent data is ultimately stored in a file system
and bugs can lead to permanent data loss in any application running on top. Part
of the contribution of the thesis is a system design and verification techniques
to scale verification to a system of the size and complexity of a file system.
In particular, the file system is designed around a transaction system that
addresses the core challenges of crashes and concurrency, so that the rest of
the code can be verified with comparatively simpler sequential reasoning. The
overall file system is performant compared to Linux NFS exporting ext4 over a
range of benchmarks --- and at least 60\% the throughput even on the most
challenging concurrent benchmarks, and 90\% on other workloads.
