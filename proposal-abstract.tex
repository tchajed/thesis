File systems are an important service of the operating system, yet
implementations still have bugs that lead to incorrect results or even data loss. Formal
verification offers a promising solution by showing that the file system always
meets its specification, even though the implementation has concurrency and
should tolerate a crash or power failure at any time. This thesis introduces
techniques for making such a proof feasible and efficient. We developed a new
file-system design that isolates the most difficult reasoning to a transaction
system while using sequential proofs for the file-system logic. In addition we
developed new techniques to reason about a highly concurrent transaction system
and prove that it provides atomicity to the file system.
