File systems are an important service of operating systems, yet implementations
have bugs that can lead to incorrect results or even data loss. What makes it
difficult to write a correct file system is that even simple operations can
execute in many ways due to concurrency and power failures, making it
challenging to think through or test all possibilities. Formal verification
offers a promising solution by using a proof to show the file system always
meets its specification. This thesis introduces a design and verification
framework that make it feasible to implement and verify the DaisyNFS file
system. Our contributions are several techniques: a design that isolates most of
the difficult reasoning to a transaction system, a specification for the
transaction system that enables simpler sequential proofs for file-system
operations, and finally a verification framework that makes reasoning about
concurrency and crash safety within the transaction system feasible.
