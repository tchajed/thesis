File systems are an important service of the operating system, yet
implementations still have bugs that lead to incorrect results or even data loss. Formal
verification offers a promising solution by showing that the file system always
meets its specification, even though the implementation has concurrency and
should tolerate a crash or power failure at any time. This thesis introduces
techniques for making such a proof feasible and efficient, with a new
verification framework and novel file-system design that isolates the most
difficult reasoning to a transaction system that provides atomic updates and
then connects to sequential proofs for the correctness of the main file-system
logic.
