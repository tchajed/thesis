\section{Overview of rest of thesis}
The thesis will have three main chapters: Goose, GoJournal, and DaisyNFS.\@
These chapters will be written to be fairly independent of each other. The Goose
chapter is new content that describes how we connect an implementation in Go to
a proof in Perennial, which is used to verify GoJournal. However, the details of
the system are not needed to understand the GoJournal specification or proof,
where we can pretend like the reasoning is directly over the Go code. We can
decouple GoJournal and DaisyNFS by recalling the top-level refinement theorem
from GoJournal within DaisyNFS in enough detail to describe how the proofs are
linked.

\section{Timeline}
The file system and transaction system implementations and proofs are complete,
which represents the bulk of the work of this thesis. We also have a fairly
complete understanding of DaisyNFS's performance compared to Linux. I aim to
complete a draft of the thesis by October 1st and leave several weeks for
feedback and revision. There are three main tasks: revising the story of the
DaisyNFS paper based on feedback from SOSP; removing redundancy between the
GoJournal and DaisyNFS papers; and describing a new and more complete
performance evaluation.
