GoTxn is a transaction system we implemented and verified with the goal of
making crash safety and concurrency simple for a storage system implemented on
top. Transactions appear to run atomically both on crash and to other threads.
The GoTxn specification formalizes this property, which we use in DaisyNFS to
enable sequential reasoning for a concurrent file system (described in
\cref{ch:daisy-nfs}).

This chapter describes GoTxn's implementation, top-level specification, and
several aspects of the proof. The implementation is composed of a software stack
with several layers; each layer implements a new interface on top of one
below. The proof follows the same structure, with much of the contributions
lying in describing intermediate abstractions. Of particular note are the
program-refinement specification for the transaction system, the lifting
specification for the journaling layer, and the abstraction for the write-ahead
log layer.

While as part of this thesis we only used GoTxn to implement and verify a file
system, in principle the system and its specification are generic for any
storage system implemented on top, as long as its operations are implemented
using transactions.
