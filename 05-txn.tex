The transaction system is the most challenging part of implementing and
verifying DaisyNFS.

The transaction system is implemented by first implementing and verifying
\emph{journaling}, which provides crash atomicity but requires the caller to
guarantee concurrent operations do not conflict. On top of journaling we
implement a transactional API with two-phase locking, an algorithm that ensures
operations don't conflict with an automatic and general locking policy.
