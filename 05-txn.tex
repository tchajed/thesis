GoTxn is a transaction system we implemented and verified with the goal of
making crash safety and concurrency simple for a storage system implemented on
top. Transactions appear to run atomically both on crash and to other threads.
The GoTxn specification formalizes this property, which we use in DaisyNFS to
enable sequential reasoning for a concurrent file system (described in
\cref{ch:daisy-nfs}).

This chapter describes GoTxn's implementation, top-level specification, and
several aspects of the proof. The implementation is composed of a software stack
with several layers; each layer implements a new interface on top of one
below. The proof follows the same structure, with several new specifications for
intermediate layers. Of particular note are the
program-refinement specification for the transaction system, the lifting
specification for the journaling layer, and the abstraction for the write-ahead
log layer.

While as part of this thesis we only used GoTxn to implement and verify a file
system, the system and its specification are generic for any
storage system implemented on top, as long as its operations are implemented
using transactions.

GoTxn faces three key challenges in its specification, design, and proof.
First, GoTxn's specification is stated in terms of programs using the
transaction system, and not all programs will observe atomic transactions ---
for example, accessing global variables or the network in the middle of a
transaction is not atomic. To state a provable specification for GoTxn we needed
a formalization of \emph{safe transactions}, described in \cref{sec:txn:safe},
which obey some restrictions that the specification assumes the caller follows.

The second challenge is supporting an in-memory allocator, which is necessary
for the file system to get good performance but would be illegal according to
GoTxn's restrictions on shared memory. To address this challenge we include an
allocator in the GoTxn API and proof. A non-deterministic,
\emph{under-specification} of the allocator makes its behavior serializable, and
\cref{ch:daisy-nfs} demonstrates that this allocator is usable by using it in
the DaisyNFS verified file system.

Finally, this specification is related to a concrete implementation, and thus
requires a proof using a program logic. The proof manages the complexity of
GoTxn's implementation by combining a \emph{lifting-based specification} that
captures the journaling layer's crash atomicity (\cref{sec:txn:lifting}) with a
simulation proof that captures how two-phase locking's concurrency control works
(\cref{sec:txn:refinement}).
