GoTxn is a transaction system we implemented and verified with the goal of
making crash safety and concurrency simple for a storage system implemented on
top. Transactions appear to run atomically both on crash and to other threads.
The GoTxn specification formalizes this property, which we use in DaisyNFS to
enable sequential reasoning for a concurrent file system (described in
\cref{ch:daisy-nfs}).

This chapter describes GoTxn's implementation, top-level specification, then
several aspects of the proof. The implementation is composed of a software stack
with several layers; each layer implements a new interface on top of one
below. The proof follows the same structure, with much of the contribution being
in describing the abstraction of each interface, including the specification for
the whole transaction system.

While as part of this thesis we only used GoTxn to implement and verify a file
system, in principle the system and its specification are generic for any
storage system implemented on top, as long as its operations are implemented
using transactions.
